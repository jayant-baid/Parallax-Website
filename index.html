                <h2 class="desc">PARA GLIDING</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="text">Paragliding is an adventure sport that involves flying through the air using a paraglider, which is a lightweight, foot-launched glider with no rigid primary structure. Paragliders are made of nylon or polyester fabric and have a harness for the pilot to sit in. To paraglide, a pilot typically runs off a hill or mountain and uses the wind to lift the paraglider into the air. Once airborne, the pilot can steer the paraglider by shifting their weight and using hand controls. 
            <br><br>
            Paragliding can be done for recreation, competition, or as a form of transportation.       Paragliding offers a unique perspective and experience of the natural world, as pilots can soar above mountains, hills, and landscapes. However, it is important to note that paragliding can be dangerous if proper safety precautions and training are not followed. It is recommended to receive proper instruction and training before attempting to paraglide on your own.

                <h2 class="desc">SURFING</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="text">Surfing is a water sport that involves riding waves while standing or lying on a board. Surfers use their arms to paddle out to the waves, and then use their legs and body weight to maneuver the board on the wave face. The goal is to ride the wave for as long as possible, performing maneuvers and tricks along the way.     Surfing originated in Hawaii in the 18th century and has since become a popular sport around the world. It is typically done in coastal areas with good waves, although indoor surfing facilities and artificial wave pools are becoming more popular.
            <br><br>
            In addition to being a fun and exciting sport, surfing has many physical and mental health benefits. It can improve cardiovascular health, balance, and flexibility, as well as reduce stress and anxiety. Additionally, surfing allows for a close connection with nature and a sense of community among surfers.     However, it is important to note that surfing can be dangerous if proper safety precautions are not followed. Surfers should be aware of their physical abilities, the conditions of the ocean, and have knowledge of surf etiquette and safety protocols.
